    "## k Nearest Neighbors and Model Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this programming assignment you will use k Nearest Neighbors (kNN) to build a \"model\" that will estimate the compressive strength of various types of concrete. This assignment has several objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. implement the kNN algorithm with k=3. Remember...the data + distance function is the model in kNN.\n",
    "2. Using Mean Squared Error (MSE):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$MSE = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum^n_i (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "evaluate the model against $y = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum y_i$ (the mean of y, $\\bar{y}$), using 10 fold cross validation.\n",
    "Some functions have been provided below.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. use validation curves to tune a *hyperparameter* of the model. \n",
    "In this case, the hyperparameter is *k*, the number of neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. evaluate the *generalization error* of the new model.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. pick one of the \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" options.\n",
    "\n",
    "Refer to the \"course notes\" for this module for most of this assignment.\n",
    "Anytime you just need test/train split, use fold index 0 for the test set and the remainder as the training set."
